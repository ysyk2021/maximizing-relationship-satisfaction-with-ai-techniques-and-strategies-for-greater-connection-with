AI refers to machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. AI algorithms are designed to continuously improve by learning from data and experience. Applying AI to relationships can help couples better understand each other's preferences, communication styles, and emotional needs, providing a more personalized and effective approach to relationship management.
